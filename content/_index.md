## My Journey in Software Engineering

I've spent the past few years building backend systems, automating infrastructure, and solving problems that matter. My journey started with a simple CLI tool during an internship and has evolved into architecting solutions that save companies money and make systems faster.

Early in my career, I contributed to a research project on gravitational wave detection using distributed systems—a brief academic detour that taught me how to think about large-scale data processing. But my real passion has always been in production engineering.

### Backend Engineering

My first taste of Go came at State Street, where I built CLI tools that automated routine workflow tasks. The immediate impact was addictive—watching manual processes disappear made me realize I wanted to spend my career doing this.

At Optum, I got the opportunity to prove that we didn't need expensive third-party licensing for everything. I built a Golang-ReactJS application that replaced a legacy IBM product and became the team's daily driver for managing deployment workflows.

Most recently at Gruve.ai, I tackled a performance problem that had been plaguing the backend. By implementing concurrent processing in Go, I transformed sluggish endpoints into responsive ones that made the product actually usable under load.

### DevOps & Cloud Migration

One of my biggest projects at Optum was migrating our entire codebase from Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) to GitHub Enterprise Cloud. This wasn't just a git migration—it involved rewriting CI/CD pipelines, retraining teams, and ensuring zero downtime during the transition. Working with distributed teams across regions, I learned the importance of clear documentation and async communication. The result: faster pipelines and a modern version control system that developers actually wanted to use.

I followed that up by migrating our Azure DevOps pipelines to GitHub Actions, which cut infrastructure costs and reduced deployment times significantly. Turns out, being hands-on with Linux scripting and the GitHub API makes you dangerous when it comes to automation.

I also implemented OAuth2 authentication with role-based access control (RBAC) for internal tools, because security shouldn't be an afterthought when you're managing production deployments.

### Frontend & Full-Stack Development

Backend engineers who can build UIs are more valuable, so I learned ReactJS and TypeScript to build complete solutions. At Optum, I improved frontend performance through better data fetching patterns and optimized the application to reduce server storage costs.

The frontend isn't just about making things pretty—it's about making data accessible quickly and presenting complex operations in ways that don't confuse users. RBAC integration meant users saw exactly what they were authorized to see, nothing more.

### Quality & Security

I take testing seriously. At Optum, I consistently pushed test coverage higher, starting at good levels and reaching excellent coverage during my associate role. Code without tests is technical debt waiting to explode.

Security was another focus: I systematically reduced our vulnerability count through dependency updates and code audits. Production issues dropped after implementing better monitoring and incident response processes.
